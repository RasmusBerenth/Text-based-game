Name: Dragon encounter
Narration: That is when the dragon appears and it seems you have gathered all of its attention. Now it is do or die your next mistake will be your last.

Name: Hidding from the dragon
Narration: You run through the cave trying to find somewhere to hide. The place you choose is...

Name: The chase
Narration: You start running towards the exit. Suddenly the dragon makes a jump and using its wings glides across the cave so that it is now in front of you. Waiting, salivating and seemingly preparing to breathe some more fire, what do you do?

Name: Escape the dragon
Narration: You got past the dragon and you manage to gain some ground on it but it won't be long before it catches up with you. You have reached the entrance and now you must find a hiding spot.

Name: Select entrance
Narration: Having searched the area earlier, you have discovered three ways into the dragon's lair. Now it's time to choose one and cross your fingers that you pick the best one.

Name: Dragon sighting
Narration: As you are heading towards the entrance, you feel a wind current flowing through the forest. What do you do?

Name: Knights camp
Narration: As you press on you see glimpses of colors not familiar to the forest. As you sneak forward, hiding in the undergrowth. In the clearing, a blue and orange tent has been set up with a fireplace in front which seems to have burnt out a while ago. What do you do? 

Name: The main entrance
Narration: As you travel through the forest hiding in the vegetation that the forest provides you spot the main entrance. As the forest ends a massive cave with stalactites hanging from the ceiling like fangs. In front of the cave a small shrine has been raised and half a dozen people in dark robes.

Name: Path from the main entrance
Narration: You have made it into the dragons' lair the roof is littered with stalactites and giant stalagmites growing from the floor, it looks like you heading towards the belly of the beast both literally and metaphorically. It seems like a bunch of the stalagmites have been broken and carved a path. How will you make your way forward?

Name: Right or left
Narration: You find yourself at an intersection from the right you hear a faint clanging sound and only silence from the left. Either way you can see a faint glow as if from a smoldering fire.

Name: Troll attack
Narration: As you head down the right path making sure you are hidden amongst the shadows. Up ahead you see silhouettes that are moving, taking a closer look you see a troll with a hemp bag climbing out of a hole in the ground. Trolls being notoriously greedy, malicious and thick-headed makes it likely that this one is going to be in the way. How should we deal with it?

Name: The underground tunnel
Narration: You have heard rumors of a tunnel network under the lair, old mines supposedly. However as you get to the tunnel entrance you spot several shapes moving around. Trolls, this might be troublesome or an opportunity. Trolls are somewhat notorious for being greedy and malicious creatures however not necessarily the most clever it is possible that you might be able to trick or lure them somehow. Choose your approach.

Name: Path or stalagmites (underground tunnel)
Narration: You are now traveling in dark, dank underground tunnels the troll in front of you guiding you threw the maze and you can't help to feel a little uneasy as you try to memorize the route (RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT) you are taking in case you have to flee, this could be some kind of trap. But nothing the journey is surprisingly uneventful and eventually you get into a large cave structure with stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites growing like trees. There seems to be a path carved out and you are informed which way leads to the treasure hoard by the troll before it leaves the other way most leads to the main entrance of the lair.

Name: Pick exit
Narration: You have the treasured time to get out of here, but how?

Name: Escaping the trolls
Narration: You slip away and eventually you reach the opening to the tunnels. But now something is really starting to bothering you the trolls seem to be on edge and there are several here now instead of the singular one that guided you here. It is good that you notice this or you wouldn't have noticed the trolls moving behind you to attack. But you do and know it's time to run. You flee into the maze taking a wrong turn could spell disaster, what was the way again?

Name: The secret door
Narration: You have heard rumors of a secret door from back when the now dragons nest was a mine and that there had been the way into a secret vault back in time immemorial, but even if that story turned out to be true then that treasure would only have been added to your target. You think that you have now located the door but when you arrive there is no door to be seen. 

Name: Path or stalagmites (secret door)
Narration: You open up the door and find a staircase leading down into the depths of the cavern the dragon has made its lair. Eventually you get to a point where the cave opens up and you see a cave with stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites growing from the ground. A path has been carved out of the stalagmites forest.

Name: Right or left (secret door)
Narration: You come to a cross-section to the right you see a faint light in the distance to the left you hear a faint clanging sound.

Name: Blocked path
Narration: As you delve deeper into the lair you start seeing more and more damage to the stalagmites and the walls and floor start having long scorch marks. You get to a point where the path is blocked by several massive stalagmites. You could probably climb over them but they seem fragile and you wouldn't want too make to much noise by breaking them. 

Name: Help knight
Narration: As you turn left and head towards the clanging sound you find a massive boulder blocking a crack in the wall, the clanging sound seemingly coming from inside. Now what?

Name: Sir Arnold the knight
Narration: The man, clearly a knight of some kind, now how to handle this.

Name: Jailbreak
Narration: You could use the spear for leverage and move the boulder it seems sturdy enough but should you. You don't know this night he could be her to take the treasure for himself.

Name: Empty hoard with knight
Narration: On your way to the hoard you spot the dragon and you duck for cover as the dragon rushes by. The moment almost stops your heart and you don't even realize the knight is surprisingly quiet. When you arrive you start collecting the treasure asking the knight for help. He doesn't answer looking over your shoulder the knight is gone. Did he get lost, did he get spotted by the dragon and what do you do know?

Name: Empty hoard
Narration: You continue on your way to the treasure making sure you stay hidden now when you are so close to your treasure. That is when a red blur moves past you with amazing speed. The dragon moves so fast you could barely believe it but it is going the opposite way so you carry on. When you get to the treasure hoard is the room empty and quiet with only a small flame burning. You start hoarding as much of the treasure that you can carry and are preparing to go.

Name: The knight and the dragon
Narration: You hurry back, now speed is now of the essence. You traverse the cave like a shadow eventually you spot the knight, good thing he has such a colorful outfit. More concerning is the massive dragon that he appears to be fighting. He might be doing better than you thought he would but this is a losing battle. He already looks tired. Warning your alarm level will now be five your next mistake will be your last!

Name: Escape via secret door
Narration: Hiding behind the stalagmite cluster you can see the dragon searching for you and it won't be long until it finds you.\n"You have saved me, I really thought I had him this time but alas this fearsome creature is too much for me!" he exclaims in a hushed tone, your just happy he has enough sense to stay quiet. That being said you need to get out of here, fast!

Name: Fight dragon
Narration: You and sir Arnold start fighting the dragon. It goes pretty well until you learn that it has merely been playing with you as it wipes out the legs from under you and sir Arnold with one movement of its tail causing him to let go of his sword. As it starts inhaling you realize you only have one more move.

Name: Dragons' hoard
Narration: The warm glow grows forcing you to rely on the stalagmites that have been growing ever larger the deeper in to the lair you have gotten. As you are traveling you start hearing deep breathing as you enter the central chamber from behind your stalagmite you see the massive hoard of gold, silver and jewels on top of which lays the dragon seemingly asleep. Behind the dragon is a smoldering flame making the gold glimmer and making the dragon's red scale form a menacing silhouette. Know how to make your approach?

Name: Making an exit
Narration: You leave the hoard behind you light of the flames in your back. All that is left is to get out without causing too much of a disturbance, better put some pep in your step the dragon could wake up anytime now. Up ahead you spot the glimmering eyes of a troll looking out from a hole in the ground. You can't let it be in your way not when you are so close to the exit. What do you do?

Name: Escape
Narration: You can see the exit the main entrance open up you can see the forest reaching for the horizon. You feel the fresh air in your lungs now all that is left is to spend your newly acquired treasure. 

Name: The end
Narration: You are not suppose to be here
